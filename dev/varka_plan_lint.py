"""Do the milestone's records hold against the tree? (VARKA-473.)

  dev/varka_plan_lint.py                     # check the m8 plan table
  dev/varka_plan_lint.py --check FILE...     # check these plan files
  dev/varka_plan_lint.py --offline           # skip the run-head check that needs `gh`
  dev/varka_plan_lint.py --require-gh        # a run head that cannot be read is a finding

A row of a milestone plan is the only record of why a change exists, and it is
prose: nothing stops it naming a run whose head is another commit, citing a
results file that was never committed, pointing at a section of a plan that has
moved, or repeating an id that is already in the table. Each of those was found
by hand in the first week of milestone 8 (row 471 named the wrong run head,
described the wrong failure, cited a suite that pins options per call and left
its provenance cell empty), and none of them is caught by a compiler.

The checks, one per line of the row:

  * the table: a numbered row's provenance cell (the third) is not empty, and no
    two rows of one table share a number;
  * paths: every backticked file the row cites - `results/...`, `VARKA-<n>.md`,
    a source file, a generated JSON - resolves in the tree, as the citing file's
    directory, the plans directory, the repository root, or a unique suffix;
  * sections: a plan file cited with a section number ("`VARKA-329.md` 9.2") has
    a heading that starts with that number;
  * rows: every number a row cites as "row N" or "rows N and M" exists in some
    milestone's table, since a citation crosses milestones without a path;
  * run heads: a row that cites exactly one Actions run and exactly one commit
    has the run's `head_sha` read through `gh api` and compared with the commit;
    with two runs or two commits the pairing is a guess, so the row is left
    unchecked rather than reported.

The default file is `sql/varka/plans/m8/PLAN.md`; the other milestone plans are
read for the row numbers a citation may name. The exit status is the number of
findings, and `--offline` leaves the run-head check to CI, which has `gh`.
