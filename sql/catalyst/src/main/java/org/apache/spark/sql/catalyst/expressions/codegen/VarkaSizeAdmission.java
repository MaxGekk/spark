/**
 * Whether the emitter serves a compiled kernel in bytes, asked of the emitter itself. The weight
 * caps admit an entry before anything is built, and weight does not bound size
 * ({@code VARKA-87.md}), so a shape the caps admit can still be one the emitter's method budget
 * declines - a single output whose own method is past it, or a driver over it. Asking at
 * classification moves that decline from every task on the executor to the plan, where EXPLAIN
 * shows it ({@code VARKA-169.md}).
 *
 * <p>The question goes through the shape cache with the key the evaluator will build, so a shape
 * is built once per JVM whoever asks first: the compiler runs at planning, for EXPLAIN and once
 * per task on the executor, and a direct emission here would put a class build on every one of
 * those. It is answered without defining a class (VARKA-237): the cache builds and measures the
 * shape and holds its bytes, and the evaluator's first lookup defines the class from them, so
 * planning on the Spark driver loads nothing, and a bisection's probes leave no class behind but
 * the one that runs. A decline names the outputs whose own group cannot fit; a class-wide one
 * names none, and the caller demotes outputs from the end, since the driver it leaves over the
 * budget grows with their number ({@code VarkaExpressionCompiler} bisects, or cuts in one step
 * where the decline carries the plan's cut, VARKA-236). Any other failure of the build admits the
 * shape as before, and is logged once per JVM: the executor meets it where it always has, behind
 * the ghost fallback. A class that builds but fails to define or link is no longer met here at
 * all, since nothing is defined: the executors meet it on its first batch, the same fallback; the
 * tests verify every admitted shape's bytes instead ({@link VarkaShapeCache#admit}).
