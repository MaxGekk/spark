/**
 * A test-only check of every address a kernel maps against the buffers the evaluator handed it.
 *
 * <p>A kernel gets raw addresses, and the size it maps each at is computed inside the kernel from
 * the batch length. The {@link java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment} bounds check enforces that size,
 * not the buffer's: a size that is wrong, or a buffer that is shorter than the kernel assumes (an
 * IPC-read buffer is sliced to its exact length, and Arrow only recommends padding), reads what
 * lies beyond it. Under {@code -Dvarka.sanitizeMemory=true} the evaluator opens a window on the
 * task thread for a batch ({@link #begin}), registers each buffer it hands out with its real
 * capacity ({@link #register}), and every mapping made on that thread ({@link
 * VarkaSegments#map}, and the engine's {@code VarkaVectorSupport.ofAddress}, which reaches
 * {@link #check} through a method handle) must lie inside one of them or fails with a {@link
 * VarkaMemoryViolation} that names the nearest.
 *
 * <p>Off, which is the default and the only mode of a benchmark, every method returns at once on
 * a {@code static final} and the JIT removes it. A thread with no window, the warm-up's thread and
 * a unit test that calls a kernel directly, is not checked. A window is per thread and per batch,
 * so a buffer's address reused by a later batch cannot hide a stale one.
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dvarka.sanitizeMemory.origins=true} also records where each buffer was registered, at
 * the cost of a stack trace each, and attaches it to a violation.
