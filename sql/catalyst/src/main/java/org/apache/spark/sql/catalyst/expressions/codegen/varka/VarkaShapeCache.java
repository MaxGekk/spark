/**
 * The Spark-facing facade over {@link VarkaShapeCacheImpl}: everything the cache needs from
 * Spark's configuration and environment lives here, and the cache itself is plain JDK code that
 * takes those as values. Two things cross this line, and only two - the capacity and the parent
 * class loader.
 *
 * <p><b>The executor-wide instance</b> (milestone 3 open question 1, settled as per-JVM: the key
 * carries no session state the linkage does not, and Janino's codegen cache is the precedent).
 *
 * <p><b>Sizing</b> is read from the JVM's own {@code SparkConf} ({@code SparkEnv}), which is the
 * one source that is the same for every thread in the JVM and fixed for its lifetime. That is
 * what makes the capacity deterministic, and it is the task-18 debt item: the previous resolution
 * consulted {@code SQLConf.get} first, which on an executor returns a task's propagated
 * {@code ReadOnlySQLConf} inside a {@code SQLExecution} and a defaults-only fallback outside one -
 * so the lazily created singleton froze whatever the first-touching thread happened to see, and
 * two identically configured executors could size differently. {@code SQLConf.get} is still the
 * fallback when there is no {@code SparkEnv} at all, which is how a catalyst unit test gets the
 * entry's default.
 *
 * <p>The boundary that leaves, documented rather than discovered:
 * {@code spark.sql.codegen.varka.cache.maxEntries} is a static SQL conf, so a
 * {@code SparkSession.builder.config(...)} value reaches an executor only when that builder also
 * created the {@code SparkContext} - only then does it land in the {@code SparkConf} the
 * executors are launched with. On a session attached to an existing context,
 * {@code SQLConf.mergeNonStaticSQLConfigs} drops static keys, so the value never takes effect
 * anywhere, driver included. Setting it with {@code --conf} (or on the builder that creates the
 * context) is the supported way.
 *
 * <p>The instance and the watch are created on first use, each behind its own holder class: the
 * class initialiser gives the once-per-JVM guarantee a {@code lazy val} gave.
