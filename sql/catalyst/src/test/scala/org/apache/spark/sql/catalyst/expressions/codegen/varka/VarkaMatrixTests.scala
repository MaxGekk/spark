/**
 * Runs each test of a Varka suite through [[VarkaMatrix.around]]: under the option matrix, a test
 * the skip list expects a configuration to break is cancelled with the entry's reason, or fails
 * as a stale entry when it passes, and each test's fused batches are recorded for the runner.
 * A test tagged `VarkaMatrix.PinsDefaults` is cancelled under any configuration. Outside the
 * matrix it changes nothing. `VarkaTestWatchdog` extends it; a suite that runs
 * without the watchdog, such as a fuzzer whose tests outlast its cap, mixes in this alone.
 *
 * Under the memory sanitizer (`-Dvarka.sanitizeMemory=true`, VARKA-263) it also holds each suite to
 * leave Arrow's root allocator where it found it: the level when the suite starts is the baseline,
 * and whatever is above it once the suite has cleaned up fails the suite by name, as Trino asserts
 * every memory pool is back to zero after each test class. Off, it changes nothing.
