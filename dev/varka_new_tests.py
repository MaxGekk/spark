"""List, rerun and base-check the Varka tests a pull request adds (VARKA-255.md 3.4).

    dev/varka_new_tests.py list catalyst|sql [--base REV]
    dev/varka_new_tests.py rerun catalyst|sql [--base REV] [--times 5] [--build-dir DIR]
    dev/varka_new_tests.py fails-on-base catalyst|sql [--base REV] [--build-dir DIR]
    dev/varka_new_tests.py --self-test

The base defaults to VARKA_DIFF_BASE, the merge base the checkout action computes; with no base,
or a base equal to the head (a run of master), there is nothing new and every command passes.

`list` prints the tests the diff from the base adds to the module's Varka suites - the
ScalaTest classes named `Varka...Suite` and the JUnit classes under `@VarkaSuite`, the set
`dev/varka_matrix.sh` runs - as `<suite>\\t<test name>`, one a line. A test is new when its name
appears in a file the diff changes and in no Varka suite of the base, so a renamed test is new
and a test moved between files is not. A name that is not a plain string literal (`s"..."`, a
concatenation with a value, a parameterized display name) cannot be listed; it is reported as
`unlistable` with its file and line, never silently dropped, and nothing reruns it.

`rerun` runs the module's new tests again, `--times` rounds of one JVM each, on the build the
job's suites step left in `--build-dir` (its classpath and JVM options), with the memory
sanitizer and both-bodies check on as the suites run them, and each round after the first under
another fuzz seed (`-Dvarka.fuzz.seed`), which is what a rerun is for in a seeded fuzz or sweep.
It fails on any failure, naming the test and the round. A listed test that ran in no round is a
notice: the listing could not match the runner's name for it.

`fails-on-base` runs only for a pull request labelled `fix` on vecbricks/varka (read with
GH_TOKEN; the push builds of the fork do not know their pull request). It builds, in a scratch
worktree, the base's main sources with the pull request's test sources over them - every changed
path outside `src/test/` checked out from the base, every such path the pull request adds
deleted - and runs the new tests there once. It passes when each fails, and fails naming each
that passes: a fix whose test passes before the fix has not shown the bug. When the overlay does
not compile, which a test helper using an API the fix adds causes, the step says "not shown:
the tests need the fix's main code" as a notice and passes.
