; The int lane's multiply-high division (VARKA-149) is exact: for each divisor d below and
; every int n, what the lanes of VarkaDivisionLowering.emitMulHiDivide compute is Java's
; n / d. Per lane, with (Mu, shift) = VarkaDivisionLowering.signedMagic(|d|):
;
;   long p = (long) n * Mu;        I2L, then LongVector.mul by the multiplier
;   int q = (int) (p >> shift);    ASHR by the shift, then L2I
;   q = q + (n >>> 31);            the dividend's sign bit, LSHR 31, added
;   if (d < 0) q = q * -1;         IntVector.mul(-1) for a negative divisor
;
; Each divisor has three checks: the form is n / d for every int n (unsat: no n where it
; is not), and it is not with the multiplier lowered by one, or with the shift raised by
; one (sat: a counterexample exists), which shows the statement can tell the derived
; constants from their neighbours.
