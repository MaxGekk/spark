# The house rules that slip most often, checked in a second over the files about
# to be committed, so they are caught here rather than by CI or a reviewer.
#
# A line-anchored finding is raised only for a line the commit itself writes: a
# file carries other people's lines - an upstream merge, prose written before a
# rule existed - and reporting those asks for an edit the committer did not come
# to make, whose only escape is --no-verify, which switches off every other check
# too. Naming files on the command line turns the scoping off, since that is a
# request to see everything in them. The whole-file checks below are unscoped.
#
#   * no non-ASCII byte in Scala, Java, Python or Markdown outside a string
#     literal (CLAUDE.md: typographic quotes, dashes and ellipses creep into
#     comments; benchmark results files are exempt, JMH writes its own +-, and
#     so are the third-party transcriptions under sql/varka/papers, whose Greek
#     letters and symbols are the papers' own text);
#   * no source line over 100 columns in Scala, Java or Python, imports, package
#     lines and URLs excepted (the linters enforce this; this is the cheap hint).
#     A Python line of one whitespace-separated chunk is exempt as well, because
#     nothing can wrap it and neither Python linter asks: ruff's E501 skips such a
#     line, and Spark's config does not select E501 at all, so `ruff format` is the
#     only Python authority on width and it cannot split a token either;
#   * no TODO or FIXME marker under sql/varka or in a Varka source directory
#     (sql/varka/AGENTS.md: open work is recorded in a plan, never left as a
#     marker);
#   * SKILLS.md's generated index still matches the lesson files under
#     sql/varka/skills/ (dev/varka_toc.py), when either changed;
#   * every number the documents quote traces to a committed results file
#     (dev/varka_quote_check.py), when a document changed;
#   * Python files pass `ruff check` and `ruff format --check`, the two halves of
#     CI's Python linter (dev/lint-python runs both; a hand-wrapped script that
#     passes the first still fails the second). A missing ruff is itself a
#     finding, because dev/lint-python skips ruff silently when it is not on PATH
#     and CI does not.
