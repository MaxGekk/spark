/**
 * The guard an emitted kernel ANDs into each word it hands {@code VectorMask.fromLong}
 * (VARKA-491). JDK 25's C2 miscompiles {@code fromLong(s, m.toLong())} on x86 without AVX-512
 * mask registers: it replaces the pair by a cast of the mask that keeps its 0/-1 lane encoding
 * where canonical booleans are expected, which a select then reads as false on every true lane
 * (VARKA-396). A masked body's known-true word becomes that pair once its columns have no nulls,
 * which C2 learns from the profile.
 *
 * <p>The kernel computes {@code word & (ones | OPEN)}. {@link #OPEN} is final, so C2 reads it as a
 * constant. Where the miscompile can happen it is zero, and the AND with {@link #ones} stays in
 * the compiled code: HotSpot never folds a static field that is not final, so the input of
 * {@code fromLong} is never the pair C2's rule matches. That costs one AND on the path from the
 * comparison to the blend; C2 still knows the word's range through it, so it needs no
 * zero-extension. Everywhere else {@code OPEN} is all ones, C2 folds the whole expression to
 * {@code word}, and the kernel compiles as if the guard were not there. The bytes are the same on
 * every host, so the emitted classes and their shape hash do not depend on it.
 *
 * <p>The JDKs the guard is for: OpenJDK tracks the miscompile as JDK-8378968 ("C2 VectorAVX AVX2:
 * wrong result, bad optimization in VectorLongToMaskNode::Ideal"), fixed in JDK 27; on
 * 27 October 2026 no JDK 25 update carries the fix, so every JDK 25 needs the guard
 * ({@code m9/SCOPE.md} item 114 follows it).
 *
 * <p>Nothing may write {@code ones}: a kernel that read anything but all ones would compute wrong
 * masks.
