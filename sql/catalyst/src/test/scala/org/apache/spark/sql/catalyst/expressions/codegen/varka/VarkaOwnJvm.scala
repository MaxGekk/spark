/**
 * A suite that runs its tests in a JVM of its own when it is run in a shared one (VARKA-246,
 * `m8/SCOPE.md` item 69). Mix it in last, after the suite's other traits.
 *
 * The tests of such a suite emit and run kernels at a lanes override other than the JVM's
 * preferred width, which puts a second vector species of one lane type into the JVM. That makes
 * the Vector API's shared templates inline bimorphically, so that every kernel compiled in the
 * JVM afterwards can box its vectors, and any test whose verdict is a JIT outcome fails by the
 * suites' order (`sql/varka/skills/vector-api-and-width.md`). [[VarkaSpeciesGuard]] fails any
 * suite that does it in the shared JVM; this trait is how a suite that must keeps its coverage.
 *
 * In the shared JVM the suite keeps its tests, by name and tags, but their bodies do not run
 * there: the first of them to run starts a child JVM with the parent's command-line arguments,
 * classpath and `-D` properties (the matrix configuration, the sanitizer, a fuzzer's budget and
 * seed) running this suite alone and writing a JUnit report, and each test then takes its result
 * from that report - passed, cancelled with the child's reason, or failed with the child's
 * message. So a name filter (`-z`, `-t`) selects the tests it names, the counts mean what they
 * did, and a failure is attributed to its test; what the filter cannot do is shorten the child,
 * which runs the whole suite. The child's output is copied to the parent's, so the matrix's markers
 * are where they were. `-Dvarka.ownJvm=true` runs the tests directly in the JVM at hand with the
 * guard off, which is how the child runs.
 *
 * The child, its budget and its report are [[VarkaChildJvm]]'s, which this trait runs with
 * ScalaTest's Runner (VARKA-312). The first test carries the suite's whole time against the
 * child's budget.
